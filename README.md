# ESP32-C3 Embedded Systems Projects (CSE 121 - UCSC)

This repository contains labs and projects built using the ESP32-C3 development board for the CSE 121 course at UC Santa Cruz. Projects include I2C sensor integration, Bluetooth HID, Morse code transmission, and HTTP networking. All projects are written in C or C++ using the ESP-IDF framework.
