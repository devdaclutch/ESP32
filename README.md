# ESP32-C3 Embedded Systems Projects (CSE 121 - UCSC)

This repository contains labs and projects built using the ESP32-C3 development board for the CSE 121 course at UC Santa Cruz. Projects include I2C sensor integration, Bluetooth HID, Morse code transmission, and HTTP networking. All projects are written in C or C++ using the ESP-IDF framework.
## Prerequisites

You **must install the ESP-IDF framework** to build and flash any of the labs.

### Install ESP-IDF

```bash
# Clone the ESP-IDF repo (recursive is critical)
git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git ~/esp/esp-idf

# Run the installer
cd ~/esp/esp-idf
./install.sh esp32c3

# Export environment (do this every new terminal session)
. ./export.sh
```

## Environment

- Board: ESP32-C3
- Toolchain: ESP-IDF (latest)
- Language: C / C++, Python

Each lab folder includes:
- `main/` source directory
- `sdkconfig`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `README.md`
- Source code only â€” `build/` is excluded

---
## Build & Flash (for any lab)
```bash
. $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh   # Set up env
idf.py set-target esp32c3       # Set chip target
idf.py build                    # Compile
idf.py flash                    # Flash to board
idf.py monitor                  # Serial output
Ctrl+] to exit monitor
```
